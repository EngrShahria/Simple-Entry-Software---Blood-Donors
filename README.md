# Simple Entry Software - Blood Donors
 This is a simple database entry software, based on Lua (Luvit). Simple Command Prompt style.

#Please check release section for getting the executable releases.

I have used Lua as primary language. Feel free to check Luvit [ https://luvit.io/ ]


This is a very simple stuff, I might work on more stuff soon or sooner?
